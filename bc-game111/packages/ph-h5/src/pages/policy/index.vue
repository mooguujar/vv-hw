            5.1.2 Before using our services, you must personally complete the registration process and agree to these terms.
            To place bets or withdraw winnings, you may need to complete a verification process, which could involve

            of a photo ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID card) and a recent utility bill that displays your
            name and address as proof of residence. We reserve the right to suspend betting or restrict certain account
            features until the requested information is received. This verification process complies with applicable gaming
            regulations and anti-money laundering laws. Additionally, you must fund your account using one of the approved
            payment methods listed on our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.1.3 You must provide accurate contact information, including a valid email address, and update it as needed to
            ensure its accuracy. It is your responsibility to keep your contact details up to date; otherwise, you may miss
            important notifications and updates, including changes to these Terms. We use your registered email address to
            identify and communicate with you. You must maintain an active and unique email address and notify us of any
            changes. Additionally, you must secure your registered email account to prevent unauthorized access. We are not
            responsible for any loss or damage resulting from communications sent to your registered email. If we are unable
            to reach you due to an invalid email address, your account may be suspended until you update your information.
            If you intentionally provide false or inaccurate personal information, we may suspend your account immediately
            after notifying you in writing. In some cases, we may take legal action and/or report the matter to relevant
            authorities, who may also take action.

            provided, we will assume that all bets, deposits, and withdrawals were made by you. To enhance security, we
            strongly recommend that you change your password regularly and never share your password with anyone. If you
            fail to protect your password, you will bear all associated risks and costs. You should log out of the services
            after each session. If you suspect that your account information has been compromised, hacked, or that your
            password has been exposed to a third party, you must notify us immediately. If your registered email has been
            hacked, you must report it to us, and we may require additional verification to confirm your identity. Once we
            become aware of such incidents, we will suspend your account immediately. During this time, you will be
            responsible for all activities carried out on your account, including unauthorized actions taken by third
            parties.

            third parties through screenshots (or similar methods). Additionally, you may not display such information in a

            10.2 We strive to publish bookmaker odds accurately. However, if a bet is accepted at incorrect odds due to
            human error or a system issue, and those odds: significantly differ from the general market odds at the time of
            the bet, or are clearly incorrect based on the actual probability of the event occurring, we reserve the right

            to be accurate. If an event is postponed or suspended and does not resume within 72 hours of its originally
            scheduled start time, it will be void and bets will be refunded. However, bets placed on team/player advancement
            or tournament winners will stand, even if the event is postponed.

          <p>
            11.10 If we publish an incorrect event date, all bets will be settled based on the date provided by the

            prior written consent, which we will not unreasonably withhold. We may assign all or part of our rights and
            obligations under these Terms to any third party without your consent, provided that the third party can provide
            a service of essentially the same quality by posting written notice on the services.

            law. The validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected.

            24.1 As a user, you agree to fully indemnify, defend, and protect the company, its affiliates, third-party
            service providers, and licensors, as well as their respective officers, directors, and employees from all
            claims, damages, losses, costs, and legal fees that arise due to: (a) Your violation of these Terms; (b) Your

            bonuses you have received, publicly disclose your real name if necessary, withhold funds from your account to
            cover damages or any amounts owed to us, until investigations or legal proceedings are completed.

          <p>
            25.3 Waiver. If we choose not to enforce any part of these Terms at a given time, it does not mean we are

            25.5 Language. If there are any differences between the English version of these terms and translations in other
            languages, the English version will always take precedence.
