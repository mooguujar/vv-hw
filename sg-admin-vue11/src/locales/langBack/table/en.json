      "system_limit_info1": "1. More domains are not always better: Each domain at a node needs to test network quality, and then the domains are ranked based on the network quality. If there are too many domain names at a node, each inspection will waste 1-2 seconds for speed testing, which may lead to network lag. It is recommended to limit the number of domains per node for each function to 2-10.",
      "system_limit_info2": "2. How to handle too many old domains? For domains that were previously used or are old, it is recommended to use URL forwarding. This not only preserves the domain authority but also allows for unlimited redirection.",
      "system_limit_info2_1": "(1) Site Backend Operation Method: Batch select domains → Batch disable (wait 5-10 minutes for the changes to take effect) → Then batch delete the domains.",
      "system_limit_info2_2": "(2) Domain Registrar Backend Operation Method: Change the DNS to the registrar's default (e.g., GoDaddy Premium DNS), then select the domain and batch set forwarding.",
      "system_limit_info3": "3. Suggested Backup Domains: These are domains that are not yet in use. It is recommended to add them only to the main domain without enabling resolution to avoid them being intercepted, hijacked, blocked, or restricted before activation. When needed, you can add them to the respective functional modules for use.",
      "system_limit_info4": "4. Fee Description:",

      "system_limit_info4_3": "(3) Node Fee: 300 USDT per unit (3 nodes provided for free, charges apply only for additional nodes)",
      "system_limit_info5": "5. Reason for recommending A8 in Mainland China: The best node for the Mainland market is A8 (Yabo exclusive node), as it is specifically optimized for Mainland China, offering significantly faster speeds. It doesn't experience lag during peak times, unlike other nodes which may occasionally have brief delays. Therefore, it is recommended to enable A8 more frequently in Mainland China.",
